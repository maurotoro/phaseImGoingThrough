    Seems like some sessions have problems with inhalation detection. Have to look at them closer
        Try to de-modulate the signal, asume that amplitude is not relevant and try to only keep freq component
        Try using the envelope, inst-amp, to do this.

    Tested modulating by Â±env/2 and it didn't work as expected, exploring the original idea, ploting all inhalations
    before each behavioral event

    3 sec peri event works beautiful, now have to create a way of doing the psth's

PorotoMeet: Evauate lattice plot for random forest regression, linear classifier,
             Classify neurons respecto to inahaliton, 
             Predict odor or desition by classification, regression logit
             ??? Get crazzy
            USe log linear models to look at interaction between neurons and inhalation and relation
